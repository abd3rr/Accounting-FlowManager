## Known Issues

### Navigation Links
Currently, each navigation link in the navbar is wrapped in its own `<ul>` tag.. Also, all the links appear as active. It's a known bug and we are actively seeking a solution for it. A temporary measure is to use CSS to override the style, but this problem needs a deeper fix in the HTML generation.

## Unused Directories

Following directories are created but not currently in use:
* `resources/fragments`
* `templates/common`

These directories have been setup for future use in organizing additional templates and fragments.
